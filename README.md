    <h2>Shri Balamurugan Temple - Devotional Centre</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The temple's main deity is Lord Murugan, who is worshipped as the god of war and victory. 
        The deity is depicted as a handsome young man riding a peacock with six faces and twelve arms. 
        The idol is made of precious stones and is adorned with gold and diamonds. 
        The temple architecture is a fine example of the Dravidian style of architecture. 
        The temple has a tall gopuram (gateway tower) at the entrance, adorned with intricate carvings of various Hindu deities. 
        The temple also has a mandapam (hall) with beautifully carved pillars, which houses the main shrine of Lord Murugan.

        Lakes are generally formed as a consequence of the tectonic or glacial activity in a typical region. Lakes are also formed due to the 
        meandering river or even by human activity. Lakes are quite important for civilization, there are abundant reasons to point them out, 
        this owes to the reason as lakes are a resource of water, and water is a definite source to continue life on this planet earth. 
        This lake is also facing numerous problems such as pollution, siltation, and encroachment due to urbanization and climate change. 
        The government and various organizations are taking steps to preserve these natural resources by investing in research to understand 
        the ecological balance, developing sustainable tourism, and educating the local community for their conservation.

    <h2>RR Garden - The Oâ‚‚ Way</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A Garden is the best place in the house. As it is the only place where a person can get relief from a busy life. 
        Moreover having a garden in the house welcomes many health benefits. For instance, a garden has many plants that give oxygen. 
        More than 310 tree species have been planted in the 25-acre arboretum, 5,500 specimens have been planted in the 10-acre conservation forest, 
        and a TDEF plant nursery has been created, capable of producing 50,000 seedlings per year to promote the re-introduction 
        of the indigenous flora of the region.

    <hr>
    <p>
        The granitic rocks in the area were formed towards the end of the Archean Era of the geological time scale, 
        due to magmatic action leading to the melting of the older gneissic rocks and intrusion. 
        The thickness of this younger granitic complex varies from 5 to 25 km. 
        Virpattu village is located in Gingee taluka of Viluppuram district in Tamil Nadu, India. 
        Viluppuram and Gingee are the district & sub-district headquarters of Virpattu village respectively. 
        Gingee is nearest town to Virpattu for all major economic activities, which is approximately 5km away.
